        <p class="about me"> <strong>Hi!</strong> My name is Wole Adebayo. I'm 36 years old and originally from Minnesota. I moved out to Washington State last year to get <em>away</em> from the awful Minnesota winters. I have worked in quite the range of careers including: various positions at Target, preschool assistant teacher, behavior therapist for kids with autism, corrections officer (in MN), and now currently I am a corrections deputy. I have always been interested in the world of programming, but ended up going to the University of Minnesota majoring in Psychology where I got my bachelor's degree. After many years of working, not quite knowing where I fit, I finally took the leap into software engineering by applying for <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School!</a></p>
        <p class="about me">I'm very excited to start! It has been a <em>dream</em> of mine to get to work in coding and website development. I had 0 experience going into the prework portion of the Flatiron School software engineering flex program and have already learned a lot. I can't wait to see what's next and how much I will learn.</p>
